# Welcome to Github Finder built with **React** and **Github API**!
### I built this app for my second solo hackathon with Mintbean. The challenge this time was to build an application that integrated the data from Github API in 5 hours. I decided to build a React app â€” Github user finder that would allow you to search for the user using their Github user name and that would render back a card with that userâ€™s info.
